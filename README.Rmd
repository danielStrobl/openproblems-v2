Proof Of Concept in adapting [Open Problems for Single Cell Analysis repository](https://github.com/singlecellopenproblems/SingleCellOpenProblems) with Nextflow and viash.

## Requirements

To use this repository, please install the following dependencies:

* Bash
* Java (Java 8 or higher)
* Docker (Instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
* Nextflow (Optional, though [very easy to install](https://www.nextflow.io/index.html#GetStarted))

## Quick start

The `src/` folder contains modular software components for running a modality alignment benchmark. Running the full pipeline is quite easy.

**Step 1, build all the components:** in the `src/` folder as standalone executables in the `target/` folder. 

```bash
bin/project_build
```

    Exporting src/modality_alignment/metrics/knn_auc/ (modality_alignment/metrics) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/modality_alignment/metrics/knn_auc
    Exporting src/modality_alignment/methods/scot/ (modality_alignment/methods) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/modality_alignment/methods/scot
    Exporting src/modality_alignment/methods/mnn/ (modality_alignment/methods) =docker=> target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/mnn
    ...

These standalone executables you can give to somebody else, and they will be able to run it, provided that they have Bash and Docker installed.
The command might take a while to run, since it is building a docker container for each of the components. 
If you're interested in building only a subset of components, you can apply a regex to the selected components. 
For example: `bin/project_build -q 'utils|modality_alignment'`.

**Step 2, run the pipeline with nextflow.** To do so, run the bash script located at `src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh`:

```bash
src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh 
```

## Adding a viash component

[`viash`](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash) allows you to create pipelines
in Bash or Nextflow by wrapping Python, R, or Bash scripts into reusable components. 
You can start creating a new component using `bin/skeleton`. For example to create
a new Python-based viash component in the `src/modality_alignment/methods/foo` folder, run:
You can start creating a new component by using the `bin/skeleton` command:

```{bash}
bin/skeleton --name foo --namespace "modality_alignment/methods" --language python
```

This should create a few files in this folder:

    script.py                A python script for you to edit.
    config.vsh.yaml          Metadata for the script containing info on the input/output arguments of the component.
    test.py                  A python script with which you can start unit testing your component.

The [Getting started](http://www.data-intuitive.com/viash_docs/) page on the viash documentation site
provides some information on how a basic viash component works, or on the specifications of the `config.vsh.yaml` [config file](http://www.data-intuitive.com/viash_docs/config/).

## Building a component

`viash` has several helper functions to help you quickly develop a component.

With **`viash build`**, you can turn the component into a standalone executable. 
This standalone executable you can give to somebody else, and they will be able to 
run it, provided that they have Bash and Docker installed.

```{bash}
viash build src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml \
  -o target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo \
  --setup
```

Note that the `bin/project_build` component does a much better job of setting up 
a collection of components. You can filter which components will be built by 
providing a regex to the `-q` parameter, e.g. `bin/project_build -q 'utils|modality_alignment'`.

## Running a component from CLI

You can view the interface of the executable by running the executable with the `-h` parameter.

```{bash}
target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo -h
```

You can **run the component** as follows:

```{bash}
target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo -i LICENSE -o foo_output.txt
```

Alternatively, you can run the component straight from the viash config by using the **`viash run`** command:
```{bash}
viash run src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml -- -i LICENSE -o foo_output.txt
```

## Unit testing a component
Provided that you wrote a script that allows you to test the functionality of a component, 
you can run the tests by using the **`viash test`** command.

```{bash}
viash test src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml
```

To run all the unit tests of all the components in the repository, use `bin/project_test`. 

## Frequently asked questions

### Running a component causes error 'Unable to find image'

Depending on how an executable was created, a Docker container might not have been created. 

To solve this issue, run the executable with a `---setup` flag attached. This will 
automatically build the Docker container for you. 

```{bash}
target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo ---setup
```

Or when working with `viash run`:

```{bash}
viash run src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml -- ---setup
```

### My component doesn't work!

Debugging your component based on the output from a Nextflow pipeline is easier than you might realise. For example, the error message below tells you that the 'mse' component failed:

``` bash
src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh 
```

Looking at this output reveals in which step of the pipeline the 'mse' component failed, namely `3d/0d6afe`. This means we should check a folder called `work/3d/0d6afe...`:

``` bash
ls -la work/3d/0d6afe9c27ab68d3f10551c3d3104c/

It seems that some error occurred within the Python script. Luckiky, the input file of this process is in this directory. We can manually run the component by running:

``` bash
viash run src/modality_alignment/metrics/mse/config.vsh.yaml -- \
  -i work/3d/0d6afe9c27ab68d3f10551c3d3104c/CBMC_8K_13AB_10x.scot.h5ad -o test.h5ad
```

Alternatively, you can edit `src/modality_alignment/metrics/mse/script.py` and replace the header by:
```python
## VIASH START
# The code between the the comments above and below gets stripped away before 
# execution. Here you can put anything that helps the prototyping of your script.
par = {
    "input": "work/3d/0d6afe9c27ab68d3f10551c3d3104c/CBMC_8K_13AB_10x.scot.h5ad",
    "output": "test.h5ad"
}
## VIASH END

## ... the rest of the script ...
```

Now you can work on the `script.py` file in your preferred editor (vim?). For easy prototyping, viash will automatically strip
away anything between the `## VIASH START` and `## VIASH END` codeblock at runtime.
