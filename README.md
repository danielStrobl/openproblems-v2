# opsca-viash
Proof Of Concept in adapting Open Problems to use viash.

## Requirements
To use this repository, make sure you have Bash, Java, and Docker installed. If you wish to use Nextflow, install that too.

## Quick start

Running the modality alignment pipeline requires two simple steps.

First, by running the command below, viash will **build all the components** in the `src/` folder as executables in the `target/` folder. 

```bash
$ bin/project_build
Exporting src/modality_alignment/metrics/knn_auc/ (modality_alignment/metrics) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/modality_alignment/metrics/knn_auc
Exporting src/modality_alignment/methods/scot/ (modality_alignment/methods) =nextflow=> target/nextflow/modality_alignment/methods/scot
Exporting src/modality_alignment/methods/mnn/ (modality_alignment/methods) =docker=> target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/mnn
...
```

This might take a while. If you're interested in building only a subset of components, you can apply a regex to the selected components by for example using the `bin/project_build -q 'utils|modality_alignment'` command.

Next, to **run the pipeline with nextflow**, run the bash script located at `src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh`:

```
$ src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh

## Adding a component with viash

[`viash`](https://github.com/data-intuitive/viash) allows you to create pipelines
in Bash or Nextflow by wrapping Python, R, or Bash scripts into reusable components. 
You can start creating a new component using `bin/skeleton`. For example to create
a new Python-based viahs component in the `src/modality_alignment/methods/foo` folder, run:
You can start creating a new component by using the `bin/skeleton` command:

```bash
bin/skeleton --name foo --namespace "modality_alignment/methods" --language python

# or:
bin/skeleton -n foo -ns "modality_alignment/methods" -l python
```

This should create a few files in this folder:

```
script.py                A python script for you to edit.
config.vsh.yaml          Metadata for the script containing info on the input/output arguments of the component.
test.py                  A python script with which you can start unit testing your component.
```

The [Getting started](http://www.data-intuitive.com/viash_docs/) page on the viash documentation site
provides some information on how a basic viash component works, or on the specifications of the `config.vsh.yaml` [config file](http://www.data-intuitive.com/viash_docs/config/).

## Building a component

`viash` has several helper functions to help you quickly develop a component.

With **`viash build`**, you can turn the component into a standalone executable. 
This standalone executable you can give to somebody else, and they will be able to 
run it, provided that they have Bash and Docker installed.

```
viash build src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml \
  -o target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo \
  --setup
```

Note that the `bin/project_build` component does a much better job of setting up 
a collection of components. You can filter which components will be built by 
providing a regex to the `-q` parameter, e.g. `bin/project_build -q 'utils|modality_alignment'`.

## Running a component from CLI

You can view the interface of the executable by running the executable with the `-h` parameter.

```
$ target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo -h
Replace this with a (multiline) description of your component.

Options:
    -i file, --input=file
        type: file, required parameter
        Describe the input file.

    -o file, --output=file
        type: file, required parameter
        Describe the output file.

    --option=string
        type: string, default: default-
        Describe an optional parameter.
```

You can **run the component** as follows:

```
$ target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo -i LICENSE -o output.txt
This is a skeleton component
The arguments are:
 - input:  /viash_automount/home/rcannood/workspace/opsca/opsca-viash/LICENSE
 - output:  /viash_automount/home/rcannood/workspace/opsca/opsca-viash/output.txt
 - option:  default-
```

Alternatively, you can run the component straight from the viash config by using the **`viash run`** command:
```
viash build src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml -- -i LICENSE -o output.txt
```

## Unit testing a component
Provided that you wrote a script that allows you to test the functionality of a component, 
you can run the tests by using the **`viash test`** command.

```
$ viash test src/modality_alignment/methods/foo/config.vsh.yaml
Running tests in temporary directory: '/home/rcannood/workspace/viash_temp/viash_test_foo8028146580425979678'

To run all the unit tests of all the components in the repository, use `bin/project_test`. 

## Frequently asked questions

### Running a component causes error 'Unable to find image'

Depending on how an executable was created, a Docker container might not have been created. 

To solve this issue, run the executable with a `---setup` flag attached. This will 
automatically build the Docker container for you. 

```
$ target/docker/modality_alignment/methods/foo/foo ---setup
> docker build -t modality_alignment/methods_foo:0.0.1 /home/rcannood/workspace/viash_temp/viashsetupdocker-foo-KeBjFs
```

Or when working with `viash run`:

```
$ viash run src/modality_alignment/methods/mnn/config.vsh.yaml -- ---setup
```

### My component doesn't work!

Debugging your component based on the output from a Nextflow pipeline is easier than you might realise. For example, the error message below tells you that the 'mse' component failed:

```
$ src/modality_alignment/workflows/run_nextflow.sh 
N E X T F L O W  ~  version 20.10.0

Looking at this output reveals in which step of the pipeline the 'mse' component failed, namely `3d/0d6afe`. This means we should check a folder called `work/3d/0d6afe...`:

```

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/tmp/viash-run-mse-WausLu", line 39, in <module>

```

It seems that some error occurred within the Python script. Luckiky, the input file of this process is in this directory. We can manually run the component by running:

```
viash run src/modality_alignment/metrics/mse/config.vsh.yaml -- -i work/3d/0d6afe9c27ab68d3f10551c3d3104c/CBMC_8K_13AB_10x.scot.h5ad -o test.h5ad
```

Alternatively, you can edit `src/modality_alignment/metrics/mse/script.py` and replace the header by:
```python
## VIASH START
# The code between the the comments above and below gets stripped away before 
# execution. Here you can put anything that helps the prototyping of your script.
par = {
    "input": "work/3d/0d6afe9c27ab68d3f10551c3d3104c/CBMC_8K_13AB_10x.scot.h5ad",
    "output": "test.h5ad"
}
## VIASH END

## ... the rest of the script ...
```

Now you can work on the `script.py` file in your preferred editor (vim?). For easy prototyping, viash will automatically strip
away anything between the `## VIASH START` and `## VIASH END` codeblock at runtime.
